# mini_web_scraper

This web scraper was developed during my time at IT Mind to streamline the process of providing laptop prices to customers. It utilizes Node.js, Express.js, and Puppeteer for web scraping, and Bootstrap 5 for creating a user-friendly interface.

## How It Works

The web scraper fetches laptop price data from supplier websites and presents it in an easy-to-use user interface. Users can filter the data based on price to quickly find laptops that meet their budget.

## Features

- Web scraping of laptop prices from supplier websites.
